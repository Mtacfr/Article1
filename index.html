        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Design:</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Phase III FLOW trial, 3,533 patients in 28 countries, with a quarter of the cohort in Europe.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Diabetic patients at high or very high renal risk, with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 47 ml/min/1.73 m² and macro-albuminuria in the majority.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Almost all (95%) were already treated with RAAS inhibitors, but only 15.6% with SGLT2 inhibitors.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Results:</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- After one year of weekly subcutaneous injection of semaglutide, a statistically significant 24% reduction in the risk of major renal events (eGFR halved, renal failure and/or death from renal or cardiovascular causes) was observed, demonstrating the efficacy of treatment in preventing these events.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Results for cardiovascular benefits associated with semaglutide: 29% reduction in cardiovascular mortality and 18% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE, including death, heart attack and stroke).</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- In terms of renal endpoints assessed separately, however, treatment had a significant effect only on patients' risk of having their eGFR halved, with this risk reduced by 27% over one year.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- All-cause patient mortality was significantly reduced by 20% with semaglutide, with one-year mortality of 12.8% in the treatment group versus 15.8% in the control group, i.e. almost one patient in six.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Effect on patients' eGFR. Over a four-year follow-up period, treated patients experienced a drop of only 2.19 ml/min/1.73 m² per year, compared with an annual drop of 3.36 ml/min/1.73 m² in control patients, and the difference was significant. The GLP-1 analogue also reduced patients' albuminuria.</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conclusion:</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- FLOW demonstrates "clear positive efficacy" of semaglutide in diabetics at high renal risk, and this molecule could constitute a new pillar in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, alongside RAAS inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors and the selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone (Kerendia*, Bayer).</span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">- By demonstrating for the first time that semaglutide significantly reduces mortality, renal risk and cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease associated with diabetes, this study confirms that the GLP-1 analogue semaglutide has many benefits that go beyond its primary use as a simple anti-diabetic.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s2">- Further randomized studies on the subject will be needed, in particular to obtain more precise data on the combination of GLP-1 analogue and/or SGLT2 inhibitor and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and thus perhaps demonstrate even better benefits.</span></p>
